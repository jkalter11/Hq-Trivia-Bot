# Hq-Trivia-Bot
A bot I made using python, I do not consider myself a expert programmer of any sorts this is just a project I wanted to try for myself.
If you want to contribute and push to this repo be my guest.

The bot takes a screen shot, then uses tesseract OCR to convert the images into text and then does google search querys on the question + answer and counts how many times a answer occurs on the page and how many results come up.
